	<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
	<p>Formed in late 2023, <code>NO NO COMPUTER</code> had our first appearance in May 2024 at Abbey Road in Cary,
	and our first full show later that month at Yonder in Hillsborough. Since then we've played from Hillsborough
        to Fuquay-Varina and would love to come play wherever you are.</p>
	<p>We play a mix of 90s alternative rock covers including Radiohead, Stone Temple Pilots, Red Hot Chili Peppers,
	Pearl Jam, and plenty more, along with some of our favorites from the backlist and a few surprises you definitely
	aren't expecting.</p>
	<h3>DETAILS</h3>
	<p>We can plug into your PA or bring our own, play under your tent or bring our own. You don't have to run
	monitors for us, we run our own. We can play 1-3 hour sets and absolutely you can sing and dance along.</p>
